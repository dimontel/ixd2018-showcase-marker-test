After you have created your logo-marker, download this repository and place your .patt file in the data folder. Change the corresponding code in index.html to point to your custom .patt.

Run the file, point your camera at your marker, and you should see a plane geometry with a video texture appear. 

Please note: this frameworks uses three.js, so you require a local host to run the file correctly, brackets.io is the easiest solution.
